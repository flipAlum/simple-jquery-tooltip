h3. Summary:

This is a small, fast and semantic plugin which utilizes event delegation and wraps the title attribute content so that it may be styled as a tooltip.
The styled tooltip replaces the native browser style title display but does not permanently alter the attribute.
The tooltip element will be positioned relative to the title containing element on mouse over.

h3. Dependencies

* "jQuery > 1.4":http://jquery.com/

h3. Basic Use:

Make sure at least some elements have a title attribute.

<code>
$(document).ready(function() {
	$(container).toolTip();
})
</code>

h3. Available Options:

* fade: true //show hide with a fade effect always false for browsers that don't support opacity

* delay: 1000 //time before the tooltip appears

* elementClass: "ui-tooltip"
  *class to add to the tooltip

* filter: ".someElem, #someOtherElem" //

* template: "" // must contain at least a wrapper element and a child element with id of tooltip-content

* fadeSpeed: "fast" //speed of the fade effect
